The opening week has been somewhat frustrating. I love the spirit of the instructors and trust in their individual competencies, but I feel that the course organization reflects how new it is.

I was pleased to see that a lot of the technologies being used where ones I've already used. Python is my native language and brings me immense pleasure, but I was even more pleased to see Github, because it allows for responsible metacoding practices. I also already had Pidgin installed on my computer, so while installing IRC was not completely smooth (navigating the Pidgin UI to make a new IRC account and add channels was not immediately straightforward), it was not bad on my end. I'd used a VM all summer, so it was a relatively familiar thing to me.

Still, problems were strongly evident. Really, it's just a single issue: we spent too much class time doing at-home setup. IRC should have been the very first priority, because after that, everything else can be installed with guides, and when things go wrong, IRC bridges the rest of the gap. No, it's not exciting to start such a novel class with chat client installation, but handling Github, VirtualBox, and iPython are all things we should have done at home. It's -because- I believe the instructors have a lot to teach and that they can teach it well that I am frustrated that we didn't get any learning done.

Still, I'm optimistic that we will get a lot done. I believe that if we lean more on outside-of-class work to get all the side stuff done, we can spend class time on the meat of reproducible data science. I'd like that
