I am tired. So, so very tired.

For those of you who don't know, this last week marked the submission of our fast coding assigment. Our class had filled out a questionnaire about our skills, leadership styles, learning styles, etc. and we had to simply visualize two fields from this questionnaire (a Google Docs spreadsheet).

I figure, no big deal. Yeah, my team of three others are completely unfamiliar with Python, but that's not really a problem. I'm reasonably experience programmer (for a college kid, anyway), and they know the R programming language, so certainly I can just teach them the syntax as we go along and we polish this easy-like.

Oh, how wrong I was.

First problem: scoping. After spending a summer at Amazon, I'd learned that things need to be scoped with WAY more time than I'd initially thought. I figure, this portion takes me half an hour? Take five hours to do it. Reasonable, right? That's an order of magnitude of difference, and I figure that's more than enough. But alas. Data curation was the first in our work pipeline, and our data curator banged her head against the code for 8 hours before I was able to assist her. It would have taken me half an hour, but as it was, it took two hours to walk her through the process and actually teach her. "Fine," I thought, "as long as she learns for the next time."

Second problem: overestimation of my colleagues' instruction. I learned this second lesson with my second teammate, our analyst. The data analysis portion is a fifteen minute job. It is LITERALLY a single function, about 20 lines. It's complicated, yes (three-layers of for loops), but it's something we should be able to do. I was wrong, however. STAT 133 TEACHES R, NOT PROGRAMMING OR COMPUTER SCIENCE. My teammates had no concept of coding style, and more importantly, while they'd used iteration once before, that didn't mean that they actually understood any of it. I paid sweat and blood to learn these; they're not simply picked up. I suspect that I was deceived much in the way that Aaron likely was: I hear that they know how to program (I took the class, after all), and I assume that they at least know the basics of how to write software. How wrong I was. Three hours was not enough to teach my analyst how to accomplish the task.

Third problem: sh*t happens. My visualizer was patient, and after six hours of working together, we managed to produce the graphs. But magically, it didn't work for our teammates or for Aaron. Then, when we tried to run another version of the code, our VM simply refused to access Git (it could access other websites just fine) until after a restart. This pushed us past the deadline, and we only made it because Aaron was generous enough to push the deadline out. Damn, we'd scoped this thing generously (so I'd thought), but it just wasn't enough.

I'd say if there's one major takeaway, it's that you can't just throw my colleagues into a programming project like this. Yes, we could have asked to use R (like many other groups chose), but my thought was, well, it'll be better for the long term if I teach them now.

BUT THEY CAN'T LEARN IT NOW! To learn how to program, and not just steer a single language, you need to start with "Hello World", you need to start from the first week, and you have to give discrete assigments to do.

As a last note, I'm appreciative of how much time Aaron puts into his office hours. I attended a bit of them personally. However, I do feel that it's a poor approach. This class emphasizes reproducibility and collaboration! Simply offering more office hours is not a scalable solution should this class ballooon to ten times this size (have you seen the CS department's growth?). This project should have been scaled so that office hours weren't AS necessary, and we should have emphasized other modes of communication, like IRC.
