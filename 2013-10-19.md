I have a policy of trying to stay quiet whenever possible. Having grown up stupidly loud and obnoxious as a kid, I began to realize that it was biting me in my ass, and I should, in general, trust people to run their own things. People older and more experienced than me, in particular, shouldn't be interrupted, because they've got more background than I do and will make better judgment calls than I will.

This should highlight how uncomfortable I had to be with this class's course in order to engage Aaron in an hourlong public discussion on #stat157. I am no longer confident that I will learn meaningful material in this class.

I have logs of the discussion, but I will instead just list out my main thoughts here for future reference:

1. No finalized list for setting up the VM. We were doing so well at first! We had step-by-step instructions on setting up the VM. But when it came time to set up more confusing things, like Vagrant, we had to rely on on in-class instructions. What if you missed the day? What if you needed to reinstall? Sorry, nothing! For 97% of the issues in this class, I would say that the problems have nothing to do with a lack of trying. But this? This should have been a Week-1 task, and here we are in the eigth or so week with nothing. For all the emphasis we put into reproducibilty, this is shameful.

2. The next problem that emerged was that documentation was always poor. How do we format reflections? Sure, there's documentation about what goes into them, but how are they collected? Via pull requests, or some other means? Sure, I know, but it's because I happened to hear Aaron say it's via a script. But what a terrible system in a class that encourages reproducibility!

`Documentation is reproducible`

Yes, I like that Aaron puts a lot of office hours up, but this isn't a cure-all! Office hours are not necessarily easy for students to make. Maybe we're across campus, or across the country, and we don't have the time to make a half-hour to-and-from trek to spend fifteen minutes getting clarification on a detail that could have been written into the documentation. Magnify this by 44 students, and this is already a poor idea. What if we want to expand this to 400 students? Relying more on documentation is like using Git on a solo project. Maybe there's a lot of overhead, and the main benefits are only evident while working with lots of people, but even just for personal reference, Git is super useful in its own right.

3. The next issue I found with the class was the choice to include Stark's lectures. Professor Stark is one of my favorite lecturers, but now is not the time to be learning about earthquakes from a statistician! You give people a user-friendly Google spreadsheet and its API, and you ask them to parse and visualize the data in the (arguably) easiest, most forgiving, and widespread programming language in the world, and they're choking up on it? Then the problem isn't that we don't know enough about earthquakes, it's that we can't program! When I get to the final earthquake project, I would MUCH rather say, "I know how to do data science, I just don't know that much about earthquakes yet" than "I know about earthquakes, I just don't know how to do data science." Thus far, I would argue that our ~8 weeks have taught us about three days worth of data science, at most. Not just programming, but even important data science practices.

4. My colleagues can't program. Part of this was a reasonable misunderstanding; certainly Stat 133 veterans should be able to pick up Python easily. But what I've discovered is that we only learned to jury-rig a particularly idiosyncratic language to do very odd things, not programming or computer science. This is not a fault of the instruction. The fact that we have not learned a basic level of Python by now, however, is fully the fault of the instruction. Accordingly...

5. The structure of a course is much, much more important than compelling lectures. I can tell that (usually) our three instructors prepare quite well for lectures, even if the lecture quality can be unpredictable. But we should take a page out of Hilfinger's CS 61B course.

Professor Paul Hilfinger is infamous throughout the CS department for, well, any class he teaches. They are particularly time-consuming and difficult. His lectures are also atrocious: to this day, I tell people that I learned as much in his lectures after 2/3rds a bottle of wine as I did while sober: nothing. But the pacing and intensity of his assignments were all just right, so even though we learned piss in his lectures, we made fantastic leaps as programmers, and to this day, most of us swear by that class. That could have been done here, through appropriately-spaced tutorials, a lecture or two dedicated to writing Python, graded quizzes on readings, etc. But introducing the first substantive assignment six weeks in, with our only learning being some ungraded Python readings jammed in the week prior as almost an afterthought, is just completely wrong all across the board. That's why our discussion about environment variable scoping last week was so painful for me. It was simultaneously too early and too late. It was too late because it was in it the seventh week of class when it should have been in the third week, and also too early because my colleagues haven't even learned about how to build a function in Python and couldn't even recognize a list!

I have some other disagreements with the management of the class, but they're largely just gripes relative to these five massive problems. If someone is really reading these reflections, I'd like someone to personally contact me and discuss it, because I feel that any of these five problems is a course-breaking problem by itself, and to have all five of these at once is wrecking this course.
