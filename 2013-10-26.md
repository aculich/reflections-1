My suspicion is that no one reads these reflections anymore. It's understandable; enthusiasm wanes in the face of piled-up personal work, and grinding through weekly blog readings certainly isn't as important as research and other responsibilities outside of this course. But it still makes me sad. I don't like it, but I've become cynical about this class. I chose it over another very important course (computer security) because I thought this class could jump start a career in data science. I look at how much time is left in this semester and the decision-making in the 9 weeks we've been through so far and it's just not happening.

In a word: organization. That's what's happened here, and what future iterations of this class, if there are any, should take out of a post-mortem. Organization should have been this class's strength: a focus on collaboration and reproducibility should have lead to a very efficiently structured course.

But there were just too many poor choices. Time spent on helping individuals one-by-one in office hours was time that could have been spent on writing better project specs. For example: what are we doing for Tuesday's mock paper assignment? Yeah, a repository recently appeared, and it might be related to the project, but there's no centralized source of wisdom as to what we are to do.

I'll keep trying; if this class miraculously turns around, I'll play ball whole-heartedly. But it was not confidence-inspiring to hear that the instructors didn't keep grades properly before Thursday. I won't hold my breath.
